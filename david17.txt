Where Is The Love The Black Eyed Peas
 
This is a great song by the Black Eyed Peas.
To Play along with the record you use the CAPO at 5.
But I find for female voices the song works better at CAPO 2.
But obviously you play it however you want to play it. Enjoy!
 
 
CAPO 5
 
[Verse]
C G Am F
 
 C
What's wrong with the world mama?
                          G
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
                    Am
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
                     F
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
                  C
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
                    G
But we still got terrorists here livin'
         Am
In the USA, the big CIA
                     F
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
 C
But if you only have love for your own race
                      G
Then you only leave space to discriminate
                   Am
And to discriminate only generates hate
                     F
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
 C
Badness is what you demonstrate
                      G
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
                  Am
N' you gotta have love just to set it straight
                      F
Take control of your mind and meditate
 
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
 
 
[Chorus]
C                   G
People killin', people dyin'
                                 Am
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
                            F
Can you practice what you preach
                                 C
And would you turn the other cheek
                          G
Father, Father, Father help us
                           Am
Send us some guidance from above
                                 F
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
              C
Where is the love (Love)
                      G
Where is the love (The love)
                      Am
Where is the love (The love)
              F
Where is the love
                 C
The love, the love
 
 
  [Verse 2]
                  C
It just ain't the same, always unchanged
 G
New days are strange, is the world insane
 Am
If love and peace is so strong
                         F
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
 
Nations droppin' bombs
 C
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
 G
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
    Am
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
            F
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
          C
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
 G
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
     Am
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
   F
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
      C
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
         G
If you never know truth then you never know love
             Am
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
             F
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)
 
Where's the love, y'all
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                   G
People killin', people dyin'
                                 Am
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
                            F
Can you practice what you preach
                                 C
And would you turn the other cheek
                          G
Father, Father, Father help us
                           Am
Send us some guidance from above
                                 F
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
              C
Where is the love (Love)
                      G
Where is the love (The love)
                      Am
Where is the love (The love)
              F
Where is the love
                 C
The love, the love
 
 
 [Instrumental]
  C G Am F
 
   C
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
   G
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
   Am
Most of us only care about money makin'
   F
Selfishness got us followin' in the wrong direction
   C
Wrong information always shown by the media
   G
Negative images is the main criteria
   Am
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
   F
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
 C                                            G
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
                                           Am
Whatever happened to the fairness in equality
                                             F
Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity
                                                  C
Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity
                                             G
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
                                             Am
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
                                             F
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
 
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found
 
 
Now ask yourself...
                C
 (Where is the love?)
                G
 (Where is the love?)
                Am
 (Where is the love?)
                F
 (Where is the love?)
 C                          G
Father, Father, Father help us
                           Am
Send us some guidance from above
                                 F
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
              C
Where is the love?
