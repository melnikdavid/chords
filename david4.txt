You Oughta Know - Alanis Morissette
[Verse 1]
F#m                       B
I want you to know that I'm happy for you.
F#m                       B
I wish nothing but the best for you both.
         F#m                     F#m
An older version of me Is she perverted like me?
              B                         B
Would she go down on you in a theater?
               F#m                        F#m
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
               B                        B
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother.
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           F#m
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
              A                            B             B
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide. No,
F#m
and every time you speak her name
         A
does she know how you told me you'd hold me
   B
until you died? Till you died, but you're still alive.
 
[Chorus]
        F#            E
And I'm here to remind you
           A                      B
of the mess you left when you went away.
         F#        E
It's not fair to deny me
         A                   B
of the cross I bear that you gave to me.
B            N.C.
You, you, you oughta know.
 
[Verse 2]
F#m
You seem very well.
B
Things look peaceful.
F#m
I'm not quite as well.
B
I thought you should know.
          F#m                  F#m
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
          B                         B
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.
         F#m                          F#m
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced,
             B                      B
and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           F#m
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
              A                            B             B
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide. No,
F#m
and every time you speak her name
         A
does she know how you told me you'd hold me
   B                                      B
until you died? Till you died, but you're still alive.
 
[Chorus]
        F#            E
And I'm here to remind you
           A                      B
of the mess you left when you went away.
         F#        E
It's not fair to deny me
         A                   B
of the cross I bear that you gave to me.

[Bridge]
          F#m
Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me,
         A                           B                            B
and I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes, and you know it.
    F#m
And every time I scratch my nails down
A
someone else's back
           B                        B
I hope you feel it. Can you feel it?
 
[Chorus]
        F#            E
And I'm here to remind you
           A                      B
of the mess you left when you went away.
         F#        E

         A                   B
of the cross I bear that you gave to me.
B            N.C.
You, you, you oughta know.
