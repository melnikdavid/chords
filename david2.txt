                        C                      C/E             F
I've been roaming around,  Always looking down at all I see
         C               C/E           F
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
 
[Chorus 1]
                      Am          C F
You know that I could use somebody
                      Am          C F
You know that I could use somebody

             C                 C/E               F
Someone like you, and all you know, And how you speak
             C          C/E           F
Countless lovers under cover of the street
 
[Chorus 1]
                      Am          C F
You know that I could use somebody
                      Am          C F
You know that I could use somebody

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
       C                  C/E             F
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
Guitar In
                  Am             C F
I hope it's gonna make you notice
                  Am             C F
I hope it's gonna make you notice
