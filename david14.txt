G   Bm/F#   Em    C
 
[Verse 1]
G                   Bm/F#
I heard that you're       settled down
         Em                         C
That you    found a girl and you're    married now
G                 Bm/F#
I heard that your dreams came true
          Em                       C
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
G                       Bm/F#
Old friend, why are you so shy?
           Em                  C
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
 
[Pre-Chorus]
  D6                         Em
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
       C
But I  couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
    D6                          Em
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
         C                Em
That for me it isn't o-   ver
 
[Chorus]
G                  D                 Em   C
  Never mind, I'll find someone like you -ou
       G               D        Em  C
I wish nothing but the best for you two
          G         D            Em         C
Don't for get me, I beg, I'll re member you said
             G                 D                     Em    C
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in stea -ead
             G                 D                     Em    C

[Verse 2]
G                  Bm/F#
  You know how the       time flies
     Em                   C
Only    yesterday was the time of our lives
        G                    Bm/F#
We were born and raised in a      summer haze
      Em                     C
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

         C           D    Em   D
That for me it isn't o    ver
