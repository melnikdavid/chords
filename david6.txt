The look - Roxette
 
[Intro]

| A | A |  A |  A |
| A | A |  A |  A |
 
[Verse 1]
A
Walking like a man, hitting like a hammer
        G
She's a juvenile scam, never was a quitter
D
Tasty like a raindrop,
              A
She's got the look
A
Heavenly bound, cause heaven's got a number
           G
When she's spinning me around, kissing is a color
    D
Her loving is a wild dog
              A
she's got the look
 
[Chorus]
              A
She's got the look (She's got the look)
              A
She's got the look (She's got the look)
            C                G                    A
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue
     C                    G              A
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
A        F           G                    A
And I go la la la la la she's got the look
 
[Verse 2]
A
Fire in the ice, naked to the t-bone
     G
Is a lover's disguise, banging on the head drum
D
Shaking like a mad bull
              A
She's got the look
A
Swaying to the band, moving like a hammer
        G
She's a miracle man, loving is the ocean
D
Kissing is the wet sand
              A
She's got the look
 
[Chorus]
A
She's got the look (She's got the look)
A
She's got the look (She's got the look)
            C                G                    A
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue
     C                    G              A
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
A        F           G                    A      A
And I go la la la la la she's got the look       Ow!

A
Walking like a man, hitting like a hammer
        G
She's a juvenile scam, never was a quitter
A
Tasty like a raindrop,
              G
She's got the look - she goes

Na na na na, na na na na na na

[Chorus]
              A
She's got the look (She's got the look)
              A
She's got the look (She's got the look)
            C                G                    A
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue
     C                    G              A
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
A        F           G                    A
And I go la la la la la she's got the look
 
[Outro]
            C         G           A
What in the world can make you so blue
     C                    G              A
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
A        F           G  (stop)
And I go la la la la la
 
[Coda]
A
Na na na na, na na na na na na
G
Na na na na, na na na na na na
D                                A
Na na na na na na, She's got the look
