N.C.
Ja! Sean Kingston!
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               A
You're way too beautiful, girl
       F#m
That's why it'll never work
               D         E
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
         A
When you say it's over
               A
Damn all these beautiful girls
     F#m
They only wanna do you dirt
                 D         E
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
          A
When they say it's over
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
       A
See, it started at the park
 
Used to chill after dark
    F#m
Oh, when you took my heart
 
That's when we fell apart
      D
Cause we both thought
     E            A
That love last forever (last forever)
     A
They say we're too young
 
To get ourselves sprung
   F#m
Oh we didn't care
 
We made it very clear
          D
And they also said
     E                   A
That we couldn't last together (last together)
 
 
[Refrain]
 
          A
See, it's very defined
 
Girl, you're a one of a kind
        F#m
But you mush up my mind
 
You oughta get declined
   D
Oh Lord...
   E                  A
My baby is drivin' me crazy
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            A
You're way too beautiful, girl
       F#m
That's why it'll never work
               D         E
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
         A
When you say it's over
               A
Damn all these beautiful girls
     F#m
They only wanna do you dirt
                 D         E
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
          A
When they say it's over
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
       A
It was back in '99
 
Watchin' movies all the time
    F#m
Oh, when I went away
 
For doin' my first crime
    D
And I never thought
     E                     A      N.C.
That we was gonna see each other (see each other)
     A
And then I came out
 
Mommy moved me down South
    F#m
Oh, I'm with my girl
 
Who I thought was my world
    D
It came out to be
     E                        A
That she wasn't the girl for me (girl for me)
 
 
[Refrain]
 
         A
See it's very defined
 
Girl, you're a one of a kind
        F#m
But you mush up my mind
 
You oughta get declined
D
Oh, Lord...
   E                  A
My baby is drivin' me crazy

You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
         A
When you say it's over
               A

Now we are fussin'
 
And now we are fighting

Please tell me why
 
I'm feelin' slightin'

And I don't know
E              A
How to make it better (make it better)
        A
