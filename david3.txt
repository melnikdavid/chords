Supergirl - Rammon

                    F#m9                          C#m7
You can tell by the way, she walks that she's my girl
                      Bm6                        Dsus2
You can tell by the way, she talks she rules the world
                   F#m9	         	              C#m7
You can see in her eyes, that no one is her chain
          Bm6           Dsus2
She's my girl, my supergirl

CHORUS
               Asus2               E9
And then she'd say, it's OK, I got lost, on the way,
                F#m9                      Dsus2
but I'm a supergirl, and supergirls don't cry
                 Asus2                     E9
And then she'd say, it's allright; I got home, late last night,
                F#m9                     Dsus2
but I'm a supergirl, and supergirls just fly

VERSE:
                F#m9			 C#m7
And then she'd say, that nothing can go wrong,
                Bm6                Dsus2
when you're in love, what can go wrong
                F#m9			  C#m7
And then she'd laugh, the night time into the day,
             Bm6           Dsus2
pushing her fears, further along

            Asus2                  E9
And then she'd say, it's OK, I got lost, on the way,
                F#m9                      Dsus2
but I'm a supergirl, and supergirls don't cry
               Asus2                     E9
And then she'd say, it's allright; I got home, late last night,
                F#m9                   Dsus2
but I'm a supergirl, and supergirls just fly

BRIDGE: (same chords as chorus)
And then she'd shout, down the line,
tell me she's got, no more time,
cause she's a supergirl, and supergirls don't hide.
And then she'd scream, in my face,
tell me to leave, leave this place,
cause she's a supergirl, and supergirls just fly.
If she's a supergirl, a supergirl..
She's sowing seeds, she's burning trees,
she's sowing seeds she's burning trees,
yeah she's a supergirl, a supergirl,
a supergirl, my supergirl.
